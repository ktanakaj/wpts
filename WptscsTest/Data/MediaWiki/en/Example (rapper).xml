'''Example''' (b. 20 June 1982 as '''Elliot John Gleave''') is a British [[singer]] and [[rapper]] currently signed to [[Data Records]]. His pseudonym arose due to his initials being '''e.g.''' which is a common abbreviation for [[E.g.#exempli_gratia|"for example"]].
==Biography==
Born 20 June 1982 at west [[London]] hospital in [[Hammersmith]], Gleave attended [[All Saints Primary School]] in [[Fulham]] High Street. He later went on to attend ADT College (now [[Ashcroft Technology Academy]]) in [[Wandsworth]], where he met his best friend and idol 'Fenners', . Gleave has claimed in interviews that the main reason he started rapping was due to his introduction to [[Hip-Hop]] through albums by [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Snoop Dogg]] – the latter's album purchased primarily for "the cool cover art".  Aged 15, Example entered his first rap battle at a house party in [[Shepherds Bush]] and in his own words "completely destroyed a useless [[wanker]] and a fight broke out so [he] sprinted home" &lt;ref name="eo.uk"&gt;[http://www.exampleonline.co.uk :: Example :: Official Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1992, he won Royal Mail Poet of the Year, winning his school a new computer. In 2000, Example attended [[Royal Holloway University]], London to study film directing. While at University, Example started [[UK garage|garage]] [[MCing]] to make some money.  It was during this period that he met Joseph Gardner AKA Rusher, the producer who he would later go on to work with. Example and Rusher made a concept album in the audio booth of the University film department which included the track that would go onto be Example's first white-label vinyl release, "A Pointless Song".

After graduating in 2003, Example moved to Australia for a year where he "did lots of landscape gardening, decorating and work on scaffolding". {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Example's sung vocals employ stylistic elements similar to that of 1970s [[Blues music]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In an interview with Sky Sports' show, [[Soccer AM]], Gleave proclaimed himself as a life long [[Fulham F.C.]] fan.

==Career==
===Early career and "What We Made" (2004–2007)===

After moving back to London, Example decided to pursue a career in music. After releasing three singles through his own label "All The Chats", including the original 7" version of "I Dont Want To" in January 2006, Example received attention from [[Pete Tong]], [[Zane Lowe]] and others at [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]].  Example also caught the attention of people at four major record labels – perhaps most significantly [[The Streets|Mike Skinner]] (of The Streets), owner of The Beats label.

After signing a deal in April 2006 with The Beats, Example put out a response to [[Lily Allen|Lily Allen's]] No.1 hit [[Smile (Lily Allen song)|"Smile"]] entitled "Vile" and received [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] airplay from [[Zane Lowe]], [[Jo Whiley]] and [[Chris Moyles]]. His first 'proper' release on The Beats was "What We Made" in November 2006, the video for which was filmed in [[Chernobyl]], Ukraine (see [[#Film making|below]]).

Example's second official Beats single entitled "You Can't Rap" was released in March 2007, followed by a re-release of "I Don't Want To" on 11 June 2007. "I Don't Want To" was followed by the single "So Many Roads" (famously sampling [[The Carpenters]] "We've Only Just Begun") which eventually turned out to be the opening track on Example's full-length studio debut. After the demise of The Beats label at the end of 2007 Example self-released his next single "Me + Mandy" on 10 March 2008 through his original imprint All The Chats. The video for "Me + Mandy" was shot over 4 days and nights in London, in over 30 locations with over 40 extras. Impressively all this was done at a cost of just £1000. It was directed by Example's friend Henry Scholfield who also made the promos for "Who Needs Sunshine?", "Vile", "You Can't Rap" and "I Don't Want To" and the video went on to win "Best Low-Budget Video" at the VMA's that year.

In February 2008 Example also tried his hand at stand-up comedy as part of [[BBC2]]'s [[The Culture Show]]. Mentored by English comic [[Richard Herring]], Example spent six weeks writing and practicing his own stand-up routine which culminated in his first ever stand-up show in front of 60 paying customers in a [[Covent Garden]] pub. A week later he appeared on the bill under Richard Herring, [[Phill Jupitus]] and [[Harry Hill]] at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]] – interestingly Example had performed in the same venue ten years earlier whilst a student at ADT College. The full 13 minute routine can be found on youtube under the title "Example Does Standup"

==="Won't Go Quietly" (2008–present)===

Example has discussed evolving into a new genre in his blogs, describing his new work as "Dysfunctional Electro-Pop". UK producers [[Chase &amp; Status]], [[Calvin Harris]] and [[MJ Cole]] contribute also to the project.

Example recently released the first single from the second album, called "[[Watch The Sun Come Up]]" through Data Records, which has proved to be moderately successful in the [[UK Singles Chart]], entering at #20 and in its second week of release rose to #19. The single spent a total of 4 weeks in the Top 40, proving to be one of Example's most successful singles to date..

The second single from the album: [[Won't Go Quietly (song)|Won't Go Quietly]] was released on 18 January 2010. The chorus is sung by Sam James and Pearse MacIntyre of the band Rogues. "Won't Go Quietly" beat previous single: "Watch The Sun Come Up"'s peak of #19 by entering the [[UK Singles Chart]] at #6, of which it spent 2 weeks within the Top 10, marking Example's most successful single thus far.

Rumours began to emerge in March 2010 that Example would be releasing the third single at some point during Summer 2010. It was confirmed in April 2010 that "Kickstarts" would be the third single from the album, and that Fenech Soler were doing one of various remixes for the single release.&lt;ref&gt;http://twitter.com/FENECHSOLER&lt;/ref&gt; The song, produced by [[Sub Focus]], received its first airplay on [[Zane Lowe]]s Radio 1 show on the 13th of April 2010. Described by Example as a mix of [[Snow Patrol]], [[MGMT]] and [[Dizzee Rascal]]. On the same show Example announced that the single would receive a June release with the album following ten days later. He also announced that there would be two more singles to follow. Kickstarts first charted on 20 June 2010 at #3. It has also been confirmed that "Last Ones Standing" and "Two Lives" will be forthcoming releases from the album.

==Film making==
Whilst filming a promo video for his track "What We Made" in the abandoned city of [[Chernobyl]] in northern [[Ukraine]], Example also filmed an 18-minute documentary in the ghost towns he visited and their deserted schools, hotels and funfairs, many of which still remain exactly as they were when they were abandoned after the infamous disaster 20 years ago. "I don't think anyone who's been here can be for nuclear power," he said, looking around at empty cots and babies' gas masks in a disintegrating schoolroom near Chernobyl. "I've read stuff recently about how we're only ever going to survive if we make nuclear power available, but you just think: why would you want it to happen after seeing this?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/nuclear/what-we-made-a-nuclear-wasteland What we made: a nuclear wasteland | Greenpeace UK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
