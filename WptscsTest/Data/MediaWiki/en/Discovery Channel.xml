'''Discovery Channel''' (formerly '''The Discovery Channel''') is an American [[satellite]] and [[cable]] [[specialty channel]] (also delivered via [[IPTV]], [[terrestrial television]] and [[internet television]] in other parts of the world), founded by [[John Hendricks]] and distributed by [[Discovery Communications]]. It is a publicly traded company run by CEO David Zaslav. It provides [[Documentary film|documentary]] [[television program]]ming focused primarily on popular science, technology, and history. In the U.S., the programming for the main Discovery network is primarily focused on [[reality television]] themes, such as speculative investigation (with shows such as ''[[MythBusters]]'', ''[[Unsolved History]]'', and ''[[Best Evidence]]''), automobiles, and occupations (''[[Dirty Jobs]]'' and ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''); it also features documentaries specifically aimed at families and younger audiences.
A popular annual feature is ''[[Shark Week]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&amp;art_aid=64477 MediaPost Publications - Discovery Rebrands, Upgrades Marketing Efforts - 07/24/2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On June 17, 1985, Discovery Channel was launched with $5&amp;nbsp;million in start-up capital from the [[BBC]], the American investment firm [[Allen &amp; Company]], Venture America and several other investors. In the beginning it was available to 156,000 households and would broadcast for 12&amp;nbsp;hours between 3&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 3&amp;nbsp;a.m. with about 75 percent of the content new to American viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/16/movies/cable-tv-notes-a-channel-with-a-difference.html?&amp;pagewanted=all|title=CABLE TV NOTES; A CHANNEL WITH A DIFFERENCE|date=June 16, 1985|publisher=New York Times | first=Steve | last=Schneider | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hendricks]] is credited with founding of the channel and its parent company, then known as Cable Educational Network Inc, in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73614317.html?dids=73614317:73614317&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+19%2C+1988&amp;author=Martie+Zad&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=The+Discovery+Channel%3B+Science%2C+Nature%2C+Adventure+and+Animals+That+Bite&amp;pqatl=google|title=The Discovery Channel; Science, Nature, Adventure and Animals That Bite|date=June 19, 1988|publisher=The Washington Post | first=Martie | last=Zad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early years, the channel broadcast some Soviet programming, including the news program ''[[Vremya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963577,00.html|title=Television: The Russians Are Coming|date=February 23, 1987|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the channel premiered the nightly program ''World Monitor'', produced by the [[Christian Science Monitor]]. 1988 also saw the very first ''[[Shark Week]]'', which has since returned annually. Within five years, the channel's reach had extended to over 50&amp;nbsp;million households.

On January 4, 2006, Discovery Communications announced that [[Ted Koppel]], longtime [[Executive Producer]] Tom Bettag, and eight former ''[[Nightline (U.S. news program)|Nightline]]'' staff members were joining the Discovery Channel.

The network's ratings improved in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.discovery.com/news/press/06q2/083006.html DCI :: Press and News Releases]&lt;/ref&gt; after a drop widely attributed to an over-reliance on a few hit series such as ''[[Monster Garage]]'' and ''[[American Chopper]]''. Some critics said such series strayed from Discovery's mold of helping viewers learn about the world around them. Beginning in 2005, Discovery revamped its lineup to focus more closely on its traditional themes of popular science, history, and geography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6361880.html Dirty Work – 8/14/2006 – Multichannel News]&lt;/ref&gt; The network garnered a total of seven primetime [[Emmy]] award nominations in 2006 for shows including ''[[The Flight that Fought Back]]'' (about [[United Airlines Flight 93]]) and ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''.

In 2007, Discovery Channel's top series include ''[[Dirty Jobs]]'' with Mike Rowe, the Emmy-award winning ''[[Planet Earth (TV series)|Planet Earth]]'', ''[[MythBusters]]'', and ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''. Discovery's announced plans for 2008 include a new series with Josh Bernstein, who left [[History Channel]] to join Discovery. Other announced series include ''[[Fight Quest]]'', ''[[Smash Lab]]'', and the fourth season of ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''.

Discovery Channel is currently the most widely distributed cable network in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncta.com/ContentView.aspx?contentId=74 Top 20 Cable Program Networks – NCTA.com]&lt;/ref&gt; reaching more than 92&amp;nbsp;million households, part of its global audience of 431&amp;nbsp;million homes in 170 countries and territories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.discovery.com/brands/discoverychannel.html DCI :: Businesses &amp; Brands :: Discovery Channel]&lt;/ref&gt; Versions of the channel are seen in Latin America, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, India, Malaysia and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.discovery.com/news/press/06q1/011806.html DCI :: Press and News Releases]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
{{main|List of programs broadcast by Discovery Channel}}

Popular programs on the channel today include [[Shark Week]], an annual week of programming dedicated to facts about [[shark]]s; ''[[Deadliest Catch]]'', about fishing for crab in the [[Bering Sea]]; ''[[MythBusters]]'', in which the hosts use steps of the [[scientific method]] to test the validity of rumors or myths; ''[[How It's Made]]'', which features how everyday objects are manufactured; ''[[Dirty Jobs]]'', about unsanitary blue-collar occupations; ''[[Cash Cab]]'', a quiz show; and ''[[Man vs. Wild]]'', showing how a man can survive in the wild. [[Christopher Lowell]] won a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] in 2000 for ''The Christopher Lowell Show'', which aired on the Discovery Channel from 1998 to 2001.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

==Non-television ventures==
===Pro Cycling Team===
{{main|Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team}}
Shortly before the 2004 [[Tour de France]], Discovery Channel announced it would become the primary sponsor of a professional bicycling team starting in 2005, featuring seven-time [[Tour de France]] winner [[Lance Armstrong]]. However, after the 2007 victory with the Spaniard [[Alberto Contador]] Discovery Channel announced its retirement from cycling sponsorship. This sponsorship ended after the 2007 cycling season.

===Discovery Channel Radio===
Discovery Channel Radio was a channel on the both major Canada [[satellite radio]] services. The programming consisted of [[sound|audio]] versions of popular programs from its multitude of TV channels. Discovery was previously on [[XM Satellite Radio]] but was dropped in early September 2005. [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] dropped Discovery Radio from its slate on February 21, 2007.

===Store===
Discovery Channel also lent its branding to retail stores in malls and other locations across America, as well as an online store. Educational gifts were the store's specialty. On May 17, 2007, Discovery Communications announced it was closing its stand-alone and mall-based stores. Hudson Group will continue to operate the Discovery Channel Airport Stores, and the website remains in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/05/17/news/companies/discovery/?postversion=2007051717 | work=CNN | title=Discovery shuttering 103 locations | date=May 17, 2007 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telescope===
{{main|Discovery Channel Telescope}}
Discovery Channel is also funding the construction of the [http://www.lowell.edu/dct/index.php Discovery Channel Telescope], in partnership with [[Lowell Observatory]].

===Website===
[http://dsc.discovery.com/ Discovery.com] features several exclusive browser-based games, with various science-based or sociological challenges.

==Marketing and branding==
===Taglines===
Discovery Channel's previous [[tagline]]s had been &quot;''Explore Your World''&quot; and &quot;''There's no thrill like discovery.''&quot; However in view of its changing focus towards more reality-based programming and away from strictly educational programming, the slogan was changed to &quot;''Entertain Your Brain''&quot;. The new tagline for the revamped Discovery Channel was &quot;''Let's All Discover...''&quot;, with a continuing phrase or sentence that relates to a show. For example, when advertising for ''[[MythBusters]]'', the commercial would end, &quot;''Let's All Discover, Why No Myth Is Safe''&quot;. With the 2008 logo change came a new tagline: &quot;''The World is Just...Awesome.''&quot; The newest commercials includes an unreleased mix of the song &quot;Wonders Never Cease&quot; by [[Morcheeba]], from the album entitled [[The Antidote (Morcheeba album)|''The Antidote'']] and the song [[Typical]] by [[MUTEMATH]]. Their most recent commercial ''[[I Love the World]]'', created by the 72andSunny agency, contains amended verses and the refrain from the traditional campfire song &quot;I Love The Mountains&quot;.

===Logos===
[[File:Discovery1985.svg|100px|thumb|left|The logo of Discovery Channel from 1985-1995.]]
[[File:Discovery Channel 1995.svg|100px|thumb|right|The next logo of Discovery Channel from 1995-2000.]]
[[File:Discovery Channel logo 2000.svg|100px|thumb|right|The third logo of Discovery Channel. Used from 2000-2009.]]

The Discovery Channel's very first logo was a television screen picturing a map of the World.
For two decades on the air, the logo incorporated the Discovery wordmark in an Aurora Bold Condensed font with a circle shape in front of it. The circle usually took the form of a rising sun, or an animated version of the [[Vitruvian Man]].

In 1995, the word &quot;The&quot; was dropped from the channel's name. A globe became a permanent part of the logo, and a strap was added to the bottom of the logo. During this time, the company started expanding and launched several new networks. Many of the sister networks used designs similar to the one used by Discovery, often incorporation the globe and using the same typeface. Networks that had logos based on Discovery's were [[Animal Planet]], [[Travel Channel]], [[Science (TV channel)|Discovery Science]], [[Military Channel|Discovery Wings]] and [[Planet Green|Discovery Home &amp; Leisure]]. The logo was changed slightly in 2000 when the word &quot;Channel&quot; was moved into the strap, and the globe was altered to focus on the Pacific Ocean.

On April 15, 2008, before the season premiere of ''[[Deadliest Catch]]'', Discovery Channel started using a new logo, new graphics and the new tagline &quot;The World is Just Awesome&quot;. The new logo has been designed by Viewpoint Creative in Boston and replaced Aurora Bold Condensed with [[Gotham (typeface)|Gotham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viewpointcreative.com/news/index.php?nc=73|title=Viewpoint Creative Designs New Discovery Channel Logo|publisher=Viewpoint Creative}}&lt;/ref&gt; The globe has been merged with the &quot;D&quot; in &quot;Discovery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/132649-Discovery_Times_New_Branding_Campaign_To_Deadliest_Catch_Debut.php|title=Discovery Times New Branding Campaign To ‘Deadliest Catch’ Debut|date=March 31, 2008|publisher=Multichannel News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This D-globe part can be detached and used separately, for example it is used as the channel's [[Digital on-screen graphic|bug]]. Later in 2009, design agency Royale slightly modified the logo, detaching the globe from the D, and made the word ''CHANNEL'' slightly bigger. The modified logo was rolled out to the rest of the world during the first half of 2009.

==International==
Discovery Channel reaches 431&amp;nbsp;million homes in 170 countries. Currently, Discovery Communications offers 29 network brands in 33 languages.

===Canada===
{{main|Discovery Channel (Canada)}}
Discovery Channel Canada has an ownership structure different from Discovery Channel.

Most notably, the Canadian channel carries the daily science news show ''[[Daily Planet (television series)|Daily Planet]]'', originally ''@discovery.ca'', the first of its kind. Occasionally, several segments on similar topics are taken from various episodes and put together into one-hour specials that are broadcast on the original Discovery Channel.

In [[Slovenia]], the Discovery Channel is one of the most popular channels, with a very wide audience, especially after subtitling in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] was introduced. It is quite common for a bar in Slovenia to set their TV to Discovery Channel. Thus it is included in all (except some basic) Cable / IPTV subscriptions.

In [[Serbia]], the Discovery Channel is distributed via cable television providers with [[Serbian language|Serbian]] subtitles. It enjoys moderate popularity, with shows like ''MythBusters'' and ''American Chopper'' being especially well received.

In Spain, the channel shares a schedule and programs with Portugal and is available through most satellite and cable platforms, making it possible to broadcast both in Spanish and Portuguese. In Spain all programs are dubbed whereas in Portugal most of them are subtitled. In addition, Portugal has three Discovery-branded channels: [[Discovery Turbo]] (motorsports), [[Discovery Science]] (science and technology) and [[Discovery Civilization]] (ancient history, crimes, terrorist attacks, etc.). They follow the same model as the original Discovery Channel, except for advertising (which doesn't exist on this channels).

==Controversy==
===RFID===
In August 2008 it was reported by The Consumerist that Discovery Channel had stopped their popular ''[[MythBusters]]'' program from airing an episode examining [[RFID]] security in regard to its implementation in [[credit cards]] because the episode would upset credit card companies, who are major advertisers on Discovery Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mythbusters Gagged: Credit Card Companies Kill Episode Exposing RFID Security Flaws|url=http://consumerist.com/5043831/mythbusters-gagged-credit-card-companies-kill-episode-exposing-rfid-security-flaws|accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later determined that the decision not to investigate the issue was made by [[Beyond Productions]], the ''MythBusters'' production company, and was not made by Discovery Channel or their advertising department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mythbusters Host Retracts RFID Censorship Comments|url=http://consumerist.com/5045633/mythbusters-host-retracts-rfid-censorship-comments|accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enigmatic Malaysia===
{{Main|2009 Pendet controversy}}

An ad promoting the network's ''Enigmatic Malaysia'', a special series meant to highlight the cultural heritages of [[Malaysia]], mistakenly featured [[Bali]]nese [[Pendet|Pendet dancers]]. This prompted outrage from Balinese dancers, who posted messages demanding that Malaysia apologize over the misinformation, which then sparked a series of street protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protests over presence of Pendet dance in Malaysia’s tourism ad continue|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/08/23/protests-over-presence-pendet-dance-malaysia%E2%80%99s-tourism-ad-continue.html?page=2|date=2009-09-03|accessdate=2009-09-03|author=Niken Prathivi and Irawaty Wardany|work=Jakarta Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further demands were made from the local governments, cultural historians as well as the tourism ministry in [[Indonesia]] for Malaysia to clarify the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jakarta Post|date=2009-08-28|author=I Wayan Juniartha|title=Pendet, the dance that rocks the cradle|work=Jakarta Post|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/08/28/pendet-dance-rocks-cradle.html|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Malaysian government reportedly offered their apologies, which was rejected by the Indonesian tourism minister, since the apology was given informally by phone, the Indonesian tourism minister demanded a written apology to make it more accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-08-27|title=Indonesian Minister Rejects Malaysian Pendet Apology|author=Dessy Sagita|work=The Jakarta Globe|accessdate=2009-09-03|url=http://thejakartaglobe.com/national/indonesian-minister-rejects-malaysian-pendet-apology/326562}}&lt;/ref&gt;
